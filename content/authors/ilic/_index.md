Marija received her Sc.D. degree in Systems Science and Mathematics from the
Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering at Washington University in
1980. She then undertook a long academic career, including senior faculty
positions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Carnegie Mellon
University. Marijaâ€™s research contributions center around modeling and control
of electric power systems. Marija has been a pioneer in treating the power
system in a hierarchical manner, leading to the introduction of interaction
variables and her DyMonDS framework for conceptualizing communication
requirements and shared variables for the power systems of today and tomorrow.
Marija has also had a distinguished career as a teacher, developing power
systems curricula at CMU and classes here at MIT, and has co-authored several
important textbooks in the field. Marija has also performed an extraordinary
amount of service on program committees, task forces, associate/guest editor
roles, and, perhaps most notably, as an NSF Program Director. Among her many
awards, she is an IEEE Life Fellow, has received the Outstanding Power
Engineering Educator Award by the IEEE Power & Energy Society, is a member of
the Academia Europaea, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
