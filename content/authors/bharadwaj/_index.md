Pallavi Bharadwaj is a Post Doctoral Research Associate at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. Marija Ilic, in
the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). She finished her
Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from Delhi College of Engineering, with a
Gold Medal in the year 2012. She studied Master’s in Engineering at Indian
Institute of Science from Aug 2012-Jul 2014 for which she received the
All-India Best Thesis Award in Power Engineering. During her PhD from Aug 2014
to Oct 2019, she worked on theoretical analysis, modelling, simulations and
hardware implementation of power electronic energy conversion systems. Key
milestones during this research were the development of a low cost and high
performance indigenous solar irradiation meter, which was highly appreciated by
the Instrument Society of India. Steady state parameter extraction and novel
sub-cell modelling of shaded photovoltaic modules are some of the most accurate
methods of PV output prediction that resulted from her thesis. In 2019, she
received BASE fellowship Award by IUSSTF and for Indo-US collaborative
research. With the motivation to make multi-layered interconnected energy
systems more efficient, she joined Prof. Ilic’s group in Jan 2020 as a
Post-doctoral research associate.
