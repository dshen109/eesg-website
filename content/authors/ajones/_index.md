Hampton, Virginia. Prior to starting a PhD in EECS at MIT, he had two
internships with the DOD-ARL energy department working with
alpha-photovolatics. Aaron's research interest include micro-grid simulations,
energy grid control systems, and renewable energy resources with an emphasis on
solar cells. Outside of work, he likes to swim, workout, and play video games.
