Don Okoye received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Texas A&M University. He followed the power and energy course track and conducted undergraduate research in cyber-physical modeling tools for power systems. Before starting MIT's LGO MBA+MS joint degree program, he spent several years working on product development for a variety of semiconductor power electronic devices at Texas Instruments. Don’s thesis is focused on long-range transmission development for integrating renewable energy into the grid, and the graduate research was conducted at NextEra’s Energy Transmission division in collaboration with EESG at MIT. Outside of school and work, Don enjoys playing intramural sports, hiking, and weight-lifting.
