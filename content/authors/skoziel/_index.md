Sylvie Koziel has a diversified education and experience working in the fields
of agronomy, energy and climate economics, electrical engineering and computer
science. She received her MSc in agronomy from AgroParisTech, and specialized
in Energy and Environmental economics at the Center of Atomic Energy and IFP
School. Her interdisciplinary background enabled her to work with different
organizations in France and Switzerland: she advised private companies, as well
as public authorities on topics related to oil and gas company strategies,
energy consumption modeling and implementation of climate mitigation measures.
She then decided to dedicate to research and is currently enrolled as a PhD
student at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH, Stockholm, Sweden), with a
focus on smart grids. In particular, she is looking into the use of data to
improve grid reliability in a profitable way, in the context of the integration
of renewable distributed generation and electric vehicles into distribution
grids. In the first years of her PhD, she performed a research visit at the
National Institute for Informatics in Tokyo (Japan). She has written a total of
23 publications, including 6 academic papers, and collaborates closely with
utilities to develop solutions in the highly strategic field of smart grids.
