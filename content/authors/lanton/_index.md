Laurentiu Anton received his BSc in Honors Mathematical Physics from the
University of Waterloo and went on to complete an MSc in Sustainable Energy
Engineering, specializing in Electric Power Engineering and Management, at
Reykjavik University (RU). His MSc thesis investigated solutions that improve
islanding resilience for the Snæfellsnes transmission system. Since then,
Laurentiu worked on over 1000 MW of solar, wind, and battery energy storage
projects both operational and at various development stages before returning to
RU to serve in both academic and administrative capacities. While at RU, and
immediately prior to joining the EESG at MIT as a PhD candidate in EECS,
Laurentiu served as a Project Manager for the Iceland School of Energy, a
Lecturer in Electrical Engineering within the Department of Engineering, as
well as the Administrative Director for the Sustainability Institute and Forum.
Laurentiu’s research seeks to support Iceland’s decarbonization efforts,
specifically with regards to transport electrification and how the Icelandic
power systems can support this transition. Outside of work, Laurentiu enjoys
reading, fitness, and nutrition. He can be spotted at meetings awkwardly taking
out his food scale to track his intake.
