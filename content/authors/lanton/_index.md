Laurentiu received his BSc in Honors Mathematical Physics from the University of Waterloo and went on to complete an MSc in Sustainable Energy Engineering, specializing in Electric Power Engineering and Management, at Reykjavik University (RU). His MSc thesis investigated solutions that improve islanding resilience for Snæfellsnes, in Iceland. Since then, Laurentiu worked on over 1 GW of solar, wind, and battery energy storage projects both operational and at various development stages before returning to RU to serve in both academic and administrative capacities. Laurentiu served as a Project Manager for the Iceland School of Energy, a Lecturer in Electrical Engineering within the Department of Engineering, as well as the Administrative Director for the Sustainability Institute and Forum, all at RU. Laurentiu’s research seeks to support grid decarbonization, renewable integration and transport electrification. He is a Co-President for the MIT Energy & Climate Club and continues to engage industry through research and consulting. Outside of work, Laurentiu enjoys reading, fitness, and nutrition. He can sometimes be spotted at meetings awkwardly taking out his food scale to track his intake.
