Daniel Shen received his bachelorâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering from the
University of California, Berkeley. Prior to starting his PhD at MIT, Daniel
worked as a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Lab, where he
developed thermal models of commercial buildings to improve technoeconomic
optimization of thermostatically controlled loads. Previously, he also worked
on end-user load flexibility in commercial refrigeration systems as a product
engineer at Axiom Cloud. More recently, he was a summer associate at The
Brattle Group in their Electricity practice. His research interests in
electricity include market design for uncertainty management, optimization and
the development of agent-based models. Outside of research, he brews espresso,
goes bouldering indoors, and is an active participant in his union.
