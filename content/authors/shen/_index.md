Daniel Shen received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the
University of California, Berkeley. Prior to starting a PhD in EECS at MIT,
Daniel worked as a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Lab, where
he developed thermal models of commercial buildings to improve technoeconomic
optimization of thermostatically controlled loads. Previously, he also worked
on load flexibility in commercial refrigeration systems as a product engineer
at Axiom Cloud. Daniel’s research interests include grid flexibility,
distributed energy resources, and consumer participation in demand side
response. Outside of work, he likes to watercolor paint, press wildflowers, and
improve his mediocre guitar skills.
