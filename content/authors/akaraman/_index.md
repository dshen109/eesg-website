Aysegül Kahraman received her BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering from the
Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Yasar University, Izmir,
Turkey. She also worked in the Energy Systems Engineering department in the
same university as a research assistant for 3 years. Her master's thesis was on
the Forecasting-Based Hybrid Model Predictive Controller for Microgrid Energy
Management. With this work, she realized that she wants to work on machine
learning for energy problems. Then, she started her Phd at the Technical
University of Denmark (DTU) with a project called "Unlocking the flexibility of
multi-energy systems using artificial intelligence approaches". She is
currently a visiting PhD student in EECS with the Electric Energy Systems Group
for 5 months, where she will continue her research on the use of reinforcement
learning algorithms in microgrids and power system applications.
