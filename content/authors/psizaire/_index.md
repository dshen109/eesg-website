Paul Sizaire received his M.Eng in Civil Engineering from Imperial College
London. He developed an interest in renewable energies while conducting
research on Wave Energy Devices. His thesis delved into clean hydrogen
production in France and Germany, in light of the recent national hydrogen
strategies. Paul currently pursues a dual degree in the Technology & Policy
Program and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His research is
focused on the development of a multi-nodal optimization model for hydrogen
supply chains. This incorporates renewable electricity generation optimization
at a regional level. Outside of work, Paul enjoys going surfing, playing piano,
reading and house music.
