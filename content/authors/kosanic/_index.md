Miroslav Kosanic received his BSc and MSc in Electrical engineering and
Computer science from the Faculty of Electrical engineering at the University
of Belgrade, Serbia. His master thesis was the application of reinforcement
learning to power system operation. That made him realize the non-existence of
a suitable benchmark for those algorithms. Currently, heâ€™s developing a
simulator that could be a first step for such a benchmark.
