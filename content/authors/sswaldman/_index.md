Satch Sumner-Waldman received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Brown
University. At Brown, Satch was involved in research related to neuroscientific applications of
engineering and became passionate about environmental applications through his work
experience. While working at Backpack Networks, he developed a wireless architecture for the
communication of embedded energy-monitoring devices to enable data-facilitated
energy-efficient appliance control. Satch’s research interests include electrical demand
prediction and electric grid control theory, and he hopes to explore these interests in graduate
studies in the future. Outside of the lab, Satch is an avid jazz keyboard player and enjoys
bouldering, playing board games, and the outdoors.
