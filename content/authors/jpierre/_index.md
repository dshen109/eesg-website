Jordina Pierre received her bachelor’s degree in physics and mathematics with a minor in computational science from the University of the Virgin Islands. Growing up in the Virgin Islands, she was faced with the problem of island wide or community outages while still being charged exorbitant electricity rates. As a result, Jordina wants her research to focus on understanding how to implement a more sustainable and cost efficient power production system in the territory. Outside of work, she likes to sing, dance, cook, and is very adventurous.
