Elaine Liu is a class of 2024 undergrad at MIT double majoring in Mathematics (18) and EECS (6-2). She is working on minimizing utility and social losses at the event of link failures in an electrical network as a UROP project. Elaine's research interest is all over the place, but mostly deal with graph problems of a combinatorial flavor. Outside of work, she likes to go on joyrides in the suburbs, powerlift, and cook for her friends
