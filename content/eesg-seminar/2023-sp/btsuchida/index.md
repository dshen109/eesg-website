title: Ancillary Services -- No Longer Ancillary

event: 'Changing Electric Energy Systems: Challenges and Opportunities'
speaker: Toshiki Bruce Tsuchida

abstract: >
    Similar to energy and capacity markets, ancillary services markets have been designed with dispatchable thermal generation in mind. The presentation discusses how and what may change in the future where intermittent renewable energy resources with near-zero short run marginal costs become dominant.
