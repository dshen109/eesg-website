## Abstract
Many countries have implemented renewables portfolio standards (RPSs) to accelerate the pace of the renewables generation deployment, which are distributed across the electric power system. As the penetration of the renewable power energy resources increases, in order to avoid unnecessary power system upgrades, Grid Enhancing Technologies (GET) are being deployed to maximize the utilization of the electric power system capacity, to control the power flow in transmission lines, and to improve the management of the health of the existing power system asset. This seminar will present some examples of the GET technologies that are currently being demonstrated by the utilities. The challenges associated with these technologies along with open problems/research areas will also be discussed.

## Bios
Babak Enayati received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University, USA in 2009. He joined National Grid, USA in 2009 and is currently the Manager of the Distributed Generation Standards and New Technology team, which is responsible for the implementation of the new technologies to meet National Gridâ€™s Intelligent Electric Network objectives. Since Babak joined National Grid, he has held engineering positions in the Protection Engineering, Retail Connections Engineering, and New Energy Solutions departments. He joined Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2006 and currently is a Senior IEEE Member. Babak currently serves as the Vice President of Education on the IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES) Governing Board. He is the current chair of the IEEE PES Transmission Subcommittee. Babak serves as the Vice Chair of the IEEE Std 1547 Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Energy Resources with Electric Power Systems, and IEEE P2800- Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Inverter-Based Resources Interconnecting with Associated Transmission Electric Power Systems. Babak is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Massachusetts.
