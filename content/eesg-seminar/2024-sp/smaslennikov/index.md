title: Oscillations in Bulk Power Systems

event: 'Oscillations in Bulk Power Systems'
speaker: Dr. Slava Maslennikov
affiliation: ISO New England

abstract: >
   Oscillations is an inherent property of power systems and need to be properly managed for secure operation of power systems. This presentation will be focusing on:
        1. Electro-mechanical oscillations and the mechanism creating inter-area oscillations.
        2. Forced oscillations; practical experience in monitoring and mitigation in ISO New England power system.
        3. Use of the synchrophasor measurements for on-line identification the source of oscillations, which is the key actionable information for efficient mitigation.
        4. Changes in oscillations landscape for the power systems with dominating Invertor Based Resources (IBR).

    Dr. Slava Maslennikov is a Technical Manager in the Advanced Technology Solutions Department at ISO New England. He received the M.S., Ph.D.  and Dr. of Sciences degrees all in power systems from the St. Petersburg Technical University (former Leningrad Polytechnic Institute), St. Petersburg, Russia in 1979, 1984 and 1998, respectively. Dr. Maslennikov has joined ISO New England in 2006 with the major role for conducting R&D in exploring, developing and implementing new technologies for improving the efficiency of companyâ€™s business processes and engineering practices. He is focusing on various aspects of power system operations and planning including power system stability, resilience, security, smart grid, synchrophasors, cascading analysis and outage coordination.
