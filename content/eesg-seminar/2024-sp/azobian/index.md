title: Software Technologies Enabling Green Energy

event: 'Software Technologies Enabling Green Energy'
speaker: Dr. Assef Zobian
affiliation: Cambridge Energy Solutions, Inc.

abstract: >
    We will discuss the importance of developing software technologies to enable the development and operation of renewable energy sources to meet the expected demand of reaching zero emissions first in the power sector. Then, in the transportation sector. Then, in heavy industries and commercial and residential sectors. And, in the end, obtain a zero-emission economy. First, we will highlight the need for software to operate the electric power markets and systems efficiently and transparently, and adapt and promote the new generation of power and storage technologies ( improve investment and participation in these markets). Focus on the DAYZER Software. Second, to improve the planning and operation of the grid, will present how software can enhance investment decisions and operations of the transmission grid to efficiently move power generation from the sites of renewable resources to the cities and areas where demand is high, at the least cost. Focus on DAYZER and TRANZER software. Third, in order to develop and optimize the operation of new technologies and interaction with the grid, software will be needed for: energy storage, the interaction between the grid and EVs, facilitating demand participation in the power markets, distributed devices, better forecasting of demand, generation of renewable resources, and finally better forecast of short-term and long-term market clearing prices.

    Dr. Zobian is Founder and President of Cambridge Energy Solutions, LLC. He is an electrical engineer with over thirty years of experience in power systems technology, economics, and planning. Prior to CES-US, Dr. Zobian was Vice President of Tabors Caramanis & Associates, where he worked on more than thirty different generation and transmission asset and rights valuations with a total value of more than $20 billion. Dr. Zobian led the team to define the structure and tariff for the first for-profit Transmission System Operator (TransCo) in the US. Before joining TCA, Dr. Zobian was a consultant at Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett, where he worked on developing models for least-cost economic dispatch for secure and economic operation of electric power systems and methods to compute the associated marginal costs of real power. Dr. Zobian has published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Transactions on Power Systems, the International Journal of Modeling & Simulation, and the IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications. Dr. Zobian earned his MS and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also has BS and ME degrees from the American University of Beirut.
