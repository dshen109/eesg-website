        This series of seminars is motivated by the need to hear from leaders in
        academia, government, and industry about major problems and opportunities in
        the rapidly changing field of power systems. The talks vary from big-picture
        holistic presentations to the focused open R&D questions that must be addressed
        to simultaneously enable decarbonization and ensure high-quality service during
        normal conditions. As extreme events become more frequent, it will be necessary
        to provide service without major widespread blackouts.

        Cooperative participation of diverse end users with many innovative hardware
        and software solutions alongside system operators can localize the effects
        of triggering events; many open questions remain as to the shape this
        cooperation will take. Similarly, there is a need for innovation in end-to-end
        integration of novel resources, demand response, grid control, etc. for
        decarbonization.

        The emphasis of this series is on the systems aspects of these challenges and
        the opportunities offered by transforming today's architectures to support
        flexible, seamless end-to-end participation of a large number of grid users.
