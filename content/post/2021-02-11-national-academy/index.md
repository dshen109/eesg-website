The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has elected 106 new members and 23
international members, announced NAE President John L. Anderson today. This
brings the total U.S. membership to 2,355 and the number of international
members to 298.

Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest
professional distinctions accorded to an engineer. Academy membership honors
those who have made outstanding contributions to “engineering research,
practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions
to the engineering literature” and to “the pioneering of new and developing
fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of
engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering
education.” Election of new NAE members is the culmination of a yearlong
process. The ballot is set in December and the final vote for membership occurs
during January.

Individuals in the newly elected class will be formally inducted during the
NAE’s annual meeting on Oct. 3, 2021. A list of the new members and
international members follows, with their primary affiliations at the time of
election and a brief statement of their principal engineering accomplishments.
