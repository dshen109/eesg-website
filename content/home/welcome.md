The Electrical Energy Systems Group (EESG) focuses on research related to
modeling, control, and communications design of our rapidly changing
electric energy system. Our mission is to enable reliable, resilient,
sustainable, and cost-effective electric energy service at scale.

We are currently part of MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). Previously, our group was based at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.eesg.ece.cmu.edu/index.php)
