**Project Objective** 

This project will develop and demonstrate an active defense mechanism of
cyber-resilient PV distribution system operation using a dynamic watermarking
technique to monitor cybersecurity. The technique involves injecting a probe
signal onto the grid to authenticate grid actions. The approach will include
the real-time deployment of online computational algorithms in real-world
critical locations. Partners include researchers from MIT, Texas A&M
University, CenterPoint Energy, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the
Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). The MIT team will develop corrective
control algorithms to mitigate the negative impact of cyber attacks.
