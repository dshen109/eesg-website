The requirement of fast generation for the case when the aggregate of small
end-devices respond versus when they do not, decreases significantly. As a
result, the wear-and-tear of the fast units reduce significantly and more
importantly, the need for these expensive units can be minimized.

The goal of the project is to utilize the flexibility offered by an aggregate
of distributed energy resources including water heaters, electric vehicles,
batteries, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. These
aggregates close to end-users are referred to as Network Optimized Distributed
Energy Resources (NODES). We utilize the notion of DyMonDS to better utilize
the end-user flexibility in light of the local uncertainties as well as the
uncertainties in price.
