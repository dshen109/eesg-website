The main objective of this project is to formalize ground-breaking general
principles in support of investment planning and operating protocols for the
changing electric energy systems. This is crucial for assessing effects
of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment
in which flexible technologies are utilized by complementing each others'
performance and by jointly meeting societal needs. Since the performance of
many technologies of interest greatly depends on how well they are integrated
over time and stakeholders (system modules), an effective framework needs to
support decisions that are data-enabled and interactive over time and among
different system decision makers. In this project a complex dynamical systems
point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions
and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of
system integration in time and space. In sharp contrast with the lack of
theoretically-provable performance in the evolving electric power system
architectures, this project explores fundamentals and takes major steps toward
solving this long-overdue problem. The most important impact will be on the way
electric power industry architectures evolve. In particular, the project will
catalyze the adoption of data-enabled decision making and automation. Notably,
this approach will help educate students to think about emerging electric
energy systems as complex dynamical systems for which much innovation is needed
and possible. Results of this research will be disseminated through a workshop
on design and control of complex energy systems.
