MIT is developing a modeling and HLA-compatible simulation platform called
SEPSS. This platform builds on an earlier TCP/IP based multi-layered
interactive computer platform named Smart Grid in a Room Simulator (SGRS)
developed in collaboration with NIST. Each user can define its own system
architecture comprising modules that have uniform functional characterization
such that the interactions can happen across multiple spatial and temporal
layers simultaneously. Given this, SEPSS can emulate hybrid system dynamics
driven by different inputs (weather, consumer preferences) and market
decisions. Both Centralized and Distributed Automated Modeling of Power Systems
(CAMPS, DAMPS) are possible. DAMPS is particularly well-suited for simulating
utility scale systems and markets.

We demonstrate the basic Transactive Energy Market (TEM) concepts on truncated
IEEE-8500 test system and some missing market signals. We then show potential
benefits on MIT-LL microgrid test systems from having more detailed market
signals such as voltage and power ramp rates.
