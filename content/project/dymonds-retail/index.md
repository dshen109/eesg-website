In this project we utilize the concept of Dynamic Monitoring and Decision
Systems (DyMoNDS) framework for IT-enabled engineering of end-to-end retail
level energy services.  The main  architecture of interest is a fully
integrated retail level energy service system for enhanced efficient, clean and
reliable energy services. The key role is to learn end users’ needs,
characteristics of the  diverse distributed energy resources and to align their
interactions through IT-enabled protocols on-line. Moreover, the integrators
can also become  a “provider of the last resource” to its end users, much the
same way as the large utility is today. They plan and invest into new
technologies for energy efficiency and quality of service to end users,
establish long-term contracts at well-defined value.
