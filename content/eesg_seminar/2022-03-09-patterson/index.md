## Abstract

Over one sextillion watt hours of electricity is consumed around the world
annually - mostly produced and distributed on demand using 100-year-old
technology. There are less than 10,000 central power plants producing most of
this electricity.  A primary reliance on this centralized production has left
us with increasingly troublesome issues of significant environmental impact,
transmission losses, geographic social and economic inequities, and the
increasing vulnerability of exposed and unsecured lines to natural and
man-caused disaster damage. In addition, historically, most power systems
simply feed \"dumb\" loads from hard wired fixed physical grids. But an
increasing focus on clean, fault tolerant, resilient, economical, and efficient
energy use is leading to us to consider transforming these systems to
significantly more interactive ones with the capability of intelligent load
management, storage, decentralized mesh wiring topologies and the employment of
an increasingly diverse set of combined clean generation sources.

This presentation discusses an expanded role for interconnected distributed
renewable energy microgrids in new mesh networks, based on hybrid use of AC and
DC power. It is posited that connecting power creation to power consumption in
a network of massively distributed microgrids will yield the analogous
capability of an 'Enernet' or electric energy network to power fixed and mobile
loads in the 21st century. The presentation will also introduce the concept of
a transactive energy framework used to enable a combination of economic and
control techniques to manage power flows within the network to optimize
operations and commerce within a multi-tiered arrangement of both public and
private microgrids and macrogrids in a Grid-of-Grids topology.
