This series of seminars is motivated by the need to hear from leaders in
academia, government, and industry about major problems and opportunities in
these rapidly changing systems. The talks vary from the big picture holistic
presentations to the focused open R&D questions that must be addressed in order
to simultaneously enable decarbonization and ensure high-quality service
during normal conditions. As extreme events become more frequent, it is
necessary to provide service without experiencing major widespread blackouts.
The challenge of localizing the effects caused by triggering events by means of
cooperative participation of diverse end-users with their many innovative
hardware and software solutions, in coordination with system operators creates
many open questions. Similarly, innovation for enabling end-to-end
integration of novel resources, demand response, grid control, storage becomes
essential for decarbonization. The emphasis of this series is on the systems
aspects of these challenges and the opportunities offered by transforming
today's architectures that support flexible, seamless end-to-end participation
of the large number of grid users.
